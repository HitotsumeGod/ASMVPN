Struct ifreq format in assembly:


                      16 Name Bits
                           |
    _______________________________________________
    |                                             |
    |                                             |
    | 0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0 |
    | 0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0 |
      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
      0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0


Bits 16-19 are to be used for a sa_family_t word in the case of a call to SIOCSIFFlAGS (first field of struct sockaddr)
Bits 20-31 are to be used for the actual inet address, specified as each number being placed in a single byte-space (NOT with db "") (second field of struct sockaddr)
